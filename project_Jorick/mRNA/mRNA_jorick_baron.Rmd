# Introductie

mRNA levels in a cell change dynamically in accordance with 3 models.

a. system is at the steady state.
b. number of mRNA is increasing over time.
c. number of mRNA is decreasing over time. 

## Goal.

we will attempt to make these models using the deSolve package.

## Theory.

the change of mRNA can be modelled using this biological model based upon. [\cite{model}](https://arep.med.harvard.edu/pdf/Chen99.pdf).

![biological model](biomodel_mRNA.png)

when we turn this biological model into a mathematical equation we get:

> dR/dt = -rR + m

R is the number of transcripts.

r is the rate of decay of existing transcripts.

m is the number of new transcripts produced per second.

#  Methods.
## The software model.
